# Convolutional Coding & BPSK Modulation over AWGN Channel

This repository contains the final project report for **CT-216: Introduction to Communication Systems**, prepared by **Group 9**. The project focuses on the design, implementation, and performance analysis of **Convolutional Codes**, and their interaction with **BPSK modulation** over an **AWGN channel**.

## 📘 Report Summary

The report covers:

- 📡 **Convolutional Coding Theory**
  - Encoder structure
  - Vector and polynomial representations
  - State and tree diagrams

- 🔁 **BPSK Modulation**
  - Mathematical formulation of BPSK signals
  - Use in noisy channels

- 📶 **AWGN Channel**
  - Signal modeling with Gaussian noise
  - Impact on Bit Error Rate (BER)

- 🧮 **Performance Analysis**
  - Theoretical vs simulated BER
  - Decoder types:
    - Hard Decision Decoding (HDD)
    - Soft Decision Decoding (SDD)
  - Transfer function derivation

## 📈 Key Takeaways

- **Soft Decision Decoding** significantly outperforms Hard Decision Decoding in terms of BER.
- **Higher constraint lengths** improve error correction but increase complexity.
- **BPSK over AWGN** serves as an effective base model for simulating digital communication reliability.
